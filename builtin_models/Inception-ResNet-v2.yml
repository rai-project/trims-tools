  Inception-ResNet-v2, a convolutional neural network (CNN) that achieves a new state of the art in terms of accuracy on the
  ILSVRC image classification benchmark. Inception-ResNet-v2 is a variation of our earlier Inception V3 model which borrows
  some ideas from Microsoft's ResNet papers. The full details of the model are in our arXiv preprint Inception-v4,
  Inception-ResNet and the Impact of Residual Connections on Learning.
