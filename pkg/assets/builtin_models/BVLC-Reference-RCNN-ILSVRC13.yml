description: >
  The pure Caffe instantiation of the R-CNN model for ILSVRC13 detection.
  This model was made by transplanting the R-CNN SVM classifiers into a fc-rcnn classification layer, provided here as an off-the-shelf Caffe detector.
  Try the detection example to see it in action.
  N.B. For research purposes, make use of the official R-CNN package and not this example.
  This model was trained by Ross Girshick @rbgirshick
